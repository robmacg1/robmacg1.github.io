# Programming for Geographic Information Analyis Portfolio

### About Me
> I am a masters student of Geographic Information Systems at the University of Leeds. I became aware of GIS during my undergraduate in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Science. Graduating in the midst of a global pandemic was less than ideal but it gave me time to reflect on what I am interested in and where I would like to take my career. To create solutions and make educated decisions to mitigate the environmental, social and political uncertainty we face ahead, understanding systemic structures and how they organise, interact and are distributed across space has never been more important. On a more personal level, I can find a lot of satisfaction in seeing for myself how data can be asscoiated with a space and what patterns can be discerned when displayed in our understanding of space thorugh the convention of mapping.
